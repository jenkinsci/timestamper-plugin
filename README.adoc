== Introduction

The Timestamper plugin adds timestamps to the console output of Jenkins jobs.
For example:

....
21:51:15  Started by user anonymous
21:51:15  Building on my-jenkins-agent
21:51:17  Finished: SUCCESS
....

== Getting started

=== Freestyle jobs

Enable timestamps within the *Build Environment* section of the build's configuration page.

To enable timestamps for multiple builds at once, use the https://plugins.jenkins.io/configurationslicing/[Configuration Slicing plugin] version 1.32 or later.

=== https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/[Pipeline] jobs

Set the global option to enable timestamps for all Pipeline builds (in *Manage Jenkins*, *Configure System*), or use the `timestamps` step as described below.

Use the `timestamps` step to wrap the rest of the Pipeline script.

[source,groovy]
----
timestamps {
    // some block
}
----

== Customization

* The timestamp format can be configured via the *Manage Jenkins*, *Configure System* page.
* There is a panel on the left-hand side of the console page which allows either the system clock time or the elapsed time to be displayed.
* The time zone used to display the timestamps can be configured by setting https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/change-time-zone/[a system property].

== Scripting

Scripts can read the timestamps from the `/timestamps/` URL of each build.
For example:

`/timestamps/`:: By default, display the elapsed time in seconds with three places after the decimal point.
`/timestamps/?time=HH:mm:ss&appendLog`:: Display the system clock time and append the line from the log.
`/timestamps/?elapsed=HH:mm:ss.S&appendLog`:: Display the elapsed time and append the line from the log.
`/timestamps/?time=HH:mm:ss&elapsed=HH:mm:ss.S`:: Display both the system clock time and the elapsed time.
`/timestamps/?currentTime&time=HH:mm:ss`:: Display the current time on the Jenkins controller.

Supported query parameters:

`time`:: Display the system clock time. Accepts the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html[JDK `SimpleDateFormat`] format.
+
NOTE: The time zone and locale of the Jenkins controller will be used, unless they are configured with the `timeZone` and `locale` query parameters.
`elapsed`:: Display the elapsed time since the start of the build. Accepts the https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/time/DurationFormatUtils.html[Commons Lang `DurationFormatUtils`] format.
`precision`:: Display the elapsed time in seconds, with a certain number of places after the decimal point. Accepts a number of decimal places or values such as `seconds` and `milliseconds`.
`appendLog`:: Display the console log line after the timestamp.
`startLine`:: Display the timestamps starting from a certain line. Accepts a positive integer to start at that line, or a negative integer to start that many lines back from the end.
`endLine`:: Display the timestamps ending at a certain line. Accepts a positive integer to finish at that line, or a negative integer to finish that many lines back from the end.
`timeZone`:: Time zone used when displaying the system clock time. Accepts the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/TimeZone.html[JDK `TimeZone`] ID format.
`locale`:: Select the locale to use when displaying the system clock time. Accepts a locale in the format recognised by https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/LocaleUtils.html#toLocale-java.lang.String-[Commons Lang `LocaleUtils#toLocale`].
`currentTime`:: Display the current time on the Jenkins controller instead of reading timestamps from the build.

CAUTION: Reading the timestamps directly from the file system is not recommended, because the format may change.

=== Java API

Other plugins can add a https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-development/dependencies-and-class-loading/#depending-on-other-plugins[dependency] on the Timestamper plugin and then use the `TimestamperAPI#read` method to retrieve the timestamps.
The `read` method accepts any query string that can be passed to the `/timestamps/` URL.
For example:

[source,java]
----
import hudson.plugins.timestamper.api.TimestamperAPI;
import java.io.BufferedReader;

String query = "time=HH:mm:ss";
try (BufferedReader reader = TimestamperAPI.get().read(build, query)) {
    // read timestamps here
}
