=== Release History

==== 1.10 and newer

See the https://github.com/jenkinsci/timestamper-plugin/releases[GitHub release page].

==== 1.9 (2019-02-07)

* Redesign of integration with Pipeline: timestamps are now written in plain text into the build log, and displayed specially if and when viewed in the classic UI. Also the `timestamps` step/option may be omitted in favor of a global option. Solves https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-48344[JENKINS-48344] - Log files generated by Jenkins pipeline scripts are bloated, https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-54081[JENKINS-54081] - Timestamps missing for agent-based steps in Pipeline Job 2.26, and (for pre-2.161 Jenkins versions) https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-55257[JENKINS-55257] - Timestamper break builds on Windows agents.

==== 1.8.10 (May 9, 2018)

* Add a forward slash to the URLs opened when clicking *View as plain text*. For some web servers, this is necessary to open the correct page. (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-50713[JENKINS-50713])
* Hide the *View as plain text* link when viewing a pipeline step because it isn't applicable to this page. (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-47051[JENKINS-47051])
* Fix the display of timestamps at the `/timestamps/` URL for pipeline builds when not using the `appendLog` flag. (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-51106[JENKINS-51106])
* Use the browser's time zone by default. This only takes affect for new users or after clearing the cookies. (https://github.com/jenkinsci/timestamper-plugin/pull/22[pull request #22]) +

====
If you use a script to read the timestamp data directly from the build log file, you will need to either:

* Modify the script to read from the `/timestamps` URL instead (recommended)
* Provide the `-Dtimestamper-consolenotes=true` VM argument when starting Jenkins to use the old format.
