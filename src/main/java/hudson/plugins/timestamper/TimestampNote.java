 * Time-stamp note that was inserted into the console note by the Timestamper
 * plugin prior to version 1.4.
 * <p>
 * The time-stamps are now stored in a separate file, which allows a more
 * compact format to be used. Having the timestamps in the console log file was
 * also inconvenient when reading the file in a text editor.
 * <p>
 * It is possible to restore the old behaviour of inserting console notes by
 * setting a system property: {@link #getSystemProperty()}. This will allow
 * scripts which expect to find the time-stamps within the console log file to
 * continue working. New scripts should rely on the page served by
 * {@link TimestampsAction} instead.
