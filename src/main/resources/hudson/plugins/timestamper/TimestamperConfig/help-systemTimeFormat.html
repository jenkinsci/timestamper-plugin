    The system clock time format defines how the timestamps will be rendered.
    The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">JDK <code>SimpleDateFormat</code></a> pattern is used.
    <p>
    Default is: <code>'&lt;b&gt;'HH:mm:ss'&lt;/b&gt; '</code><br>
    For a more detailed format use: <code>yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS' | '</code>.
